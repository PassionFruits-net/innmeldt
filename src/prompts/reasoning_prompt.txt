You are given a user question and a numbered list of context chunks. Your task is to determine whether the context provided answers the question, and if so, which chunks are relevant.
## Instructions:
Carefully read the question: {question}
### Review the numbered context chunks:
{chunks}

### Then, in your reasoning:
Think through whether the context, taken as a whole, provides an answer to the question.
Identify which specific chunks are relevant to answering the question.
Explain your thought process clearly, noting what information in the relevant chunks supports the answer and why other chunks are not relevant.

Finally, list the indexes of the relevant chunks.
