You're tasked with evaluating the relevance of each chunk to the given user query. Assign a relevance score between 0 and 1 for each chunk based on how well it answers or addresses the query.

## Scoring Guidelines:
0: No relevance at all
0-0.2: Adjacent topic, but not relevant
0.2-0.4: Same topic, but not relevant to the query
0.4-0.6: Somewhat relevant; related but not clearly useful
0.6-0.8: Mostly relevant; covers key points, but lacks precision or completeness
0.8-1: Indirectly or partially answers the question
1: Directly answers the exact question

## User Query:
